# Supervised_Machine_Learning
Purpose, difficulties, results
The purpose of this project is compare Oversampling with Undersampling machine learning
with various techniques and combine them for SMOTEEN algorithm.
Using the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company,
I’ll oversample the data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms, and undersample the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm.
Then, I’ll use a combinatorial approach of over- and undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm.
Finally, I’ll compare two new machine learning models that reduce bias,
BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier, to predict credit risk.
