# Supervised_Machine_Learning
Purpose, difficulties, results
The purpose of this project is compare Oversampling with Undersampling machine learning
with various techniques and combine them for SMOTEEN algorithm.

RandomOverSampler 
balanced accuracy score: 64.6%
SMOTE algorithms
balanced accuracy score: 65.8%
ClusterCentroids
balanced accuracy score: 54.4%

A combinatorial approach of over- and undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm.
balanced accuracy score: 63.6%

Finally, Iâ€™ll compare two new machine learning models that reduce bias to predict credit risk
BalancedRandomForestClassifier
EasyEnsembleClassifier
